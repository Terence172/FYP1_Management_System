## Description
The FYP1 Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the management of Final Year Project (FYP) processes in an academic institution. The system caters to multiple user roles including Admin, Student, Supervisor, Evaluator, and Committee members. It provides a centralized platform for managing academic programs, lecturer information, committee assignments, student registrations, proposal submissions, evaluations, and more.

With the FYP1 Management System, administrators can efficiently manage the academic programs offered by the institution. They can add, edit, or remove programs such as Data Engineering and Software Engineering. Additionally, administrators have the ability to maintain a list of lecturers and assign committee members based on the lecturer list and academic programs.

Committee members play a crucial role in the system. They can assign research or development domains to each lecturer, manage student lists, and oversee all project proposals. Committee members have access to view proposals based on semester and academic session, including detailed information, evaluation results, comments, and more. They are responsible for assigning two evaluators to each student's proposal, ensuring that the supervisor does not evaluate their own student's proposals.

Students are able to register their personal details in the system and select a preferred supervisor from the available list. Once the supervisor is approved by the committee, a general agreement between the student and supervisor is displayed. Students can then submit their project proposals, providing essential details such as the project title, type (research or development), and filling out the online proposal form or uploading a signed PDF form. They can view the status of their proposals (accepted, accepted with conditions, or rejected) and review evaluator comments. If needed, students can resubmit their proposals based on the feedback received.

Supervisors have access to view their own students based on the semester and academic session. They can review student proposals, leave comments before the evaluator assessment, and view evaluation results along with evaluator comments.

Evaluators play a vital role in the system by reviewing assigned proposals and downloading all related documents. They evaluate each proposal, selecting a status (accepted, accepted with conditions, or rejected) and providing detailed comments for feedback.

The FYP1 Management System provides a comprehensive solution for managing the entire FYP process, offering an efficient and transparent workflow for administrators, committee members, students, supervisors, and evaluators.
